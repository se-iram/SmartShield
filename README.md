# SmartShield â€“ Face Verification Application

**SmartShield** is a functional web application that verifies a live face captured via webcam against stored anchor images using a **Siamese Neural Network** built and trained by the team. The model is trained from scratch and deployed via a Python-based backend (Flask) for real-time face-verification.

---

## Project Overview

SmartShield enables real-time identity verification by comparing live webcam input with reference ("anchor") images. The system computes similarity scores using a trained Siamese model and classifies the input as either "Verified" or "Unverified" based on a threshold.

This system respects all hackathon rules:
- Machine learning model trained entirely by the team.
- No usage of LLM APIs or pretrained wrappers (e.g. ChatGPT, BERT).
- All code (training, ML model, backend, frontend) is fully open sourced.
- Includes frontend and backend components.
- Deployed live for user testing.

## Installation & Running Locally

### Requirements
- Python 3.10
- A webcam (for live testing)
- Optional: Virtual environment

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-shield-app.git
cd smart-shield-app
python -m venv env
# Activate virtual env (Windows: env\Scripts\activate, Mac/Linux: source env/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Use the Start Camera button to enable the camera, then Verify Face to test match results.

---
### How It Works
- Preprocessing
- Input images resize to (105 Ã— 105 Ã— 3)
- Scaling using normalized pixel values ([0,1] range)
- Model Inference
- Siamese network compares anchor vs live frame
- Outputs similarity score between 0â€“1
- Decision Logic
- If score > threshold (default 0.5), returns Verified
- Otherwise returns Unverified
### UI Flow
- User clicks Start Camera
- Webcam feed appears
- User clicks Verify Face
- Server saves frame, computes similarity, returns result
- UI displays result in green/red text accordingly

---

### Model Training Details
- Architecture: Siamese Neural Network (custom L1Dist layer)
- Training performed in a Jupyter notebook/Colab:
- Anchor, positive, negative image sampling
- Used TensorFlow 2.x, trained from scratch
- Model saved as TensorFlow SavedModel via model.export()

---

### Deployment Notes
- For lightweight deployment and demos, the project can be deployed on:
  - Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio or Flask with static hosting
  - Render, Railway, or Heroku (for Flask backend)
  - Ensure model/siamesemodel is compressed if over 25MB for GitHub compatibility
